* batch mode that sends more than 1 tweet & also has ability to send via file
* want to be able to read lines from file
- overcome limitations of CLI input, namely adding '$' to a line.
- do this by reading from a file in /tw/f/yyyymmmdd.txt
- inside file we have the following layout

  hh:mm message

- where
    
    hh = hours in 24 hours
    mm = minutes from 0 to 59
    space
    message that is <= 140 characters

- operation

   ./tw.py -f $HOME/path/to/file/yyyymmmdd.txt

+ read filename    
   yyyymmmdd.txt
       22:47 10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10
+ if its valid continue, else bug out
+ read file line by line
+ check line format for valid date + space + message < 140char + newline
+ add to a list/dictionary
+ then call twi send methods
+ if there's more than one line, either check post date or add timer from 
  config & send. 
+ continue till end
